Sobald es um das Thema Gehalt geht, fehlt vielen MFA bzw.\n                ArzthelferInnen das Gespür für eine konkrete Zahl. Ein typisches\n                Beispiel, das du bestimmt auch kennst: du hast dich gerade auf\n                einen Job beworben und der neue Chef fragt dich nach deinen\n                Gehaltsvorstellungen. Natürlich willst du nicht zu dreist sein\n                und das potenzielle Jobangebot durch zu hohe Gehaltswünsche in\n                Gefahr bringen. Deshalb gehen viele medizinische Fachangestellte\n                lieber auf Nummer sicher und verkaufen sich am Ende unter Wert.\n            </p>\n            <h2>\n                Wie ermittelt man eigentlich seinen Marktwert?\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                In den vielen Gruppen und Foren kommen regelmäßig Fragen zur\n                Höhe des Gehalts in Voll- und Teilzeit für MFA auf. Wenn ich bei\n                manchen Kommentaren lese, dass eine MFA mit 15 Jahren\n                Berufserfahrung in ein und derselben Praxis mit 1.900 € brutto\n                nach Hause geht, finde ich das einfach nur sehr schade und\n                traurig.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Damit dir das nicht passiert, bekommst du in diesem Artikel von\n                MFA mal anders Informationen über Gehalt, Tarifverträge und\n                Tätigkeitsgruppen für MFAs und ArzthelferInnen. Mit diesem\n                Wissen, kannst du deinen eigenen Marktwert einordnen und\n                selbstbewusst für einen leistungsorientierten und fairen Lohn\n                einstehen.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Vorweg klären wir zuerst ein paar Begrifflichkeiten und wie die\n                vertragliche Lage aussieht.\n            </p>\n            <h2>\n                Gehaltstarifvertrag {{ new Date().getFullYear() }} – MFA /\n                ArzthelferIn\n            </h2>\n            <b-row>\n                <b-col>\n                    <p>\n                        Der Verband medizinischer Fachberufe e.V.

Sie vertritt uns medizinische\n                        Fachangestellte bei Tarifverhandlungen gegenüber der\n                        Arbeitsgemeinschaft zur Regelung der Arbeitsbedingungen\n                        der ArzthelferInnen / Medizinischen Fachangestellten\n                        (AAA). Die AAA ist die Tarifpartei der Arbeitgeber,\n                        sprich der niedergelassenen Ärzte.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Die niedergelassenen Ärzte sind nicht automatisch\n                        Mitglied in der AAA. Deshalb kann man nicht zwingend\n                        davon ausgehen, dass sich Praxen an die Gehälter im\n                        Tarifvertrag halten müssen. Arbeitgeber sind nur dann\n                        dazu verpflichtet Gehälter nach Tarifvertrag zu zahlen,\n                        wenn sowohl sie Mitglied im AAA als auch die MFA\n                        Mitglied im VMF sind.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Ehrlich gesagt, kenne ich nicht viele MFAs, die Mitglied\n                        im VMF sind. Daher wundert es auch nicht, dass so viele\n                        von uns untertariflich verdienen, wie die Kollegin aus\n                        dem Forum im obigen Beispiel.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Dennoch gibt es viele Ärzte, die sich freiwillig an den\n                        aktuellen Tarifvertrag halten oder zumindest das Gehalt\n                        für ihre medizinischen Fachangestellten daran anlehnen.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Neben dem offiziellen Tarifvertrag existieren zahlreiche\n                        Gehaltstarifverträge von privaten Unternehmen,\n                        Krankenhäusern, dem öffentlichen Dienst (z.B. wenn du\n                        bei der Kassenärztlichen Vereinigung arbeitest) und\n                        kirchlichen Trägern (wie der Caritas, der Diakonie oder\n                        der Johanniter).\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Es kommt im privaten Bereich oftmals zu einer\n                        außertariflichen Bezahlung. Das muss nicht unbedingt\n                        negativ für dich ausfallen. Viele MFA werden dadurch\n                        übertariflich bezahlt.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Wenn dein Chef kein Mitglied im AAA ist, du aber darauf\n                        bestehst, dass dein Gehalt nach Tarifvertrag bezahlt\n                        wird, kannst du alternativ mit deinem Arbeitgeber\n                        vereinbaren, dass er sich freiwillig daran hält. Hier\n                        ist es ratsam, eine entsprechende Klausel im\n                        Arbeitsvertrag aufnehmen zu lassen, die die Abmachung\n                        bindend macht.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Der Tarifvertrag hat natürlich auch einen ganz\n                        entscheidenden Vorteil: er wird regelmäßig neu\n                        verhandelt. Das Gehalt wird somit beinahe jährlich immer\n                        etwas angepasst und erhöht. Ist dein Chef verpflichtet\n                        nach Tarifvertrag zu zahlen oder hält sich freiwillig\n                        daran, musst du also keine Gehaltsverhandlungen mit dem\n                        Chef führen.\n                    </p>\n                </b-col>\n                <b-col>\n                    <p>\n                        Daneben bietet der Gehaltstarifvertrag für medizinische\n                        Fachangestellte dir vor allem eine gute Orientierung, um\n                        deinen Marktwert einzuschätzen, was Qualifikation und\n                        Erfahrung angehen.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Den aktuellen Gehaltstarifvertrag für medizinische\n                        Fachangestellte findest du\n                        <a\n                            href=\"https://www.vmf-online.de/mfa/mfa-tarife\"\n                            target=\"_blank\"\n                            rel=\"noopener\"\n                            >hier</a\n                        >.\n                    </p>\n                    <Gehaltsrechner class=\"my-4\" />\n                    <FacebookBtn\n                        class=\"mb-4 mr-1\"\n                        content=\"Folgen und keine Neuigkeiten verpassen\"\n                    />\n                    <FacebookShareBtn class=\"mb-4\" />\n                </b-col>\n            </b-row>\n\n            <ToJobboardBanner class=\"my-5 mx-auto\" />\n\n            <h2>\n                Anrechnung von Berufsjahren\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                Ein wichtiger Indikator für die Höhe des Gehalts von MFA sind\n                Erfahrung und Expertise, die man sich im Laufe seines\n                Berufslebens aneignet.

Der erste Eindruck muss stimmen</h3>\n            <p>\n                Die Bewerbung muss optisch ansprechend aussehen. Dafür brauchst\n                du keine Skills eines Grafikers, um eine gut strukturierte und\n                übersichtliche Bewerbung zu erstellen. In unserer Vorlage musst\n                du nur noch deinen Text einfügen.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Tipp: Passe die Farben in deiner Bewerbung denen des\n                Unternehmens an. Das vermittelt direkt, dass du dich mit der\n                Firma beschäftigt hast und dich mit ihr identifizierst. Es wird\n                bei der Person, die deine Bewerbung sichtet, ein positives\n                Gefühl erzeugen. Außerdem wirken deine Unterlagen individueller.\n            </p>\n            <h3 class=\"h5 bold\">2. Das Bewerbungsbild ist kein Muss mehr</h3>\n            <p>\n                Früher musste jeder Bewerbung ein Foto beigefügt sein. Heute ist\n                das nicht mehr gängige Praxis und viele Arbeitgeber erwähnen es\n                auch nicht mehr in den Anforderungen an eine Bewerbung.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Wenn du ein Bild von dir mitschicken möchtest, sollte es von\n                guter Qualität und kein offensichtliches Selfie oder Urlaubsfoto\n                sein. Es muss nicht im Blazer sein, sollte aber seriös und\n                sympathisch aussehen. Falls du kein Foto von dir hast, muss du\n                kein schlechtes Gewissen haben, wenn du keins mitschickst. Ein\n                Arbeitgeber sollte deine Qualitäten nicht nach dem Aussehen oder\n                daran messen, ob du ein Bild deiner Bewerbung anhängst.\n            </p>\n            <h2 class=\"mb-4\">Das Motivationsschreiben</h2>\n            <h3 class=\"h5 bold\">1.
