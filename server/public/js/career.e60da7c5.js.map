Ausbildungsjahr\r\n        </h3>\r\n        <p class=\"mb-0\">\r\n          Im dritten Lehrjahr kommt das große Themenfeld der Prävention auf den\r\n          Unterrichtsplan. Die Azubis lernen, wie Krankheiten vermieden werden\r\n          und die Gesundheit gefördert wird. MFAs belgleiten in ihrem\r\n          Praxisalltag den Patienten oft dabei, indem sie ihn beraten und\r\n          unterstützen. Verantwortungsvolle Tätigkeiten am Patienten, wie das\r\n          Blutabnehmen oder Fäden ziehen, runden die Ausbildung ab.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"example\">\r\n        <h3 class=\"h5\">\r\n          Berichtsheft\r\n        </h3>\r\n        <p class=\"mb-0\">\r\n          Während der gesamten Ausbildungszeit müssen die Azubis ein\r\n          Berichtsheft pflegen und ihre regelmäßigen Aufgaben sowie das\r\n          Erlernte, praktisch wie theoretisch, schriftlich festhalten. Der\r\n          Ausbilder, in der Regel der Praxisinhaber, ist verpflichtet die\r\n          angefertigten Berichte zu überwachen und mit seiner Unterschrift zu\r\n          bestätigen. Das Berichtsheft kann man also als eine Art\r\n          Ausbildungsnachweis ansehen und ist Voraussetzung, um die Ausbildung\r\n          abschließen zu können und zur Abschlussprüfung zugelassen zu werden.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <h2>\r\n        Zwischen- und Abschlussprüfung\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Am Ende des zweiten Ausbildungsjahres findet eine Zwischenprüfung statt,\r\n        um den Wissensstand der Auszubildenden abzufragen. Die Prüfung ist\r\n        schriftlich und dauert 120 Minuten. Dabei werden alle Themenfelder\r\n        abgefragt, die die Azubis bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt in der Berufsschule\r\n        kennengelernt haben.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Um zur Abschlussprüfung zugelassen zu werden, müssen die Azubis an der\r\n        Zwischenprüfung teilgenommen haben und ihr Berichtsheft bei der\r\n        Ärztekammer eingereicht haben.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Die Abschlussprüfung wird am Ende des dritten Ausbildungsjahres\r\n        absolviert und gliedert sich in einen schriftlichen und einen\r\n        praktischen Prüfungsteil. Die schriftlichen Klausuren umfassen insgesamt\r\n        300 Minuten.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Bei der praktischen Prüfung ziehen die Auszubildenden in der Regel aus\r\n        mehreren Umschlägen ihre Prüfungsaufgabe. Insgesamt dauert die\r\n        praktische Prüfung 75 Minuten. In dieser Zeit bearbeiten die\r\n        Auszubildenden ihre Prüfungsaufgabe und bereiten sich auf das\r\n        Prüfungsgespräch mit den Prüfern vor. Die Auszubildenden spielen dabei\r\n        eine typische Situation aus dem Praxisalltag nach, z.B. wie eine MFA\r\n        einen chirurgischen Tisch vorbereitet. Danach erfolgt ein abschließendes\r\n        Fachgespräch von maximal 15 Minuten, indem die Auszubildenden ihr\r\n        Vorgehen erklären und einige Fachfragen zu der Thematik beantworten.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Bei erfolgreich absolvierter schriftlicher und praktischer Prüfung mit\r\n        einer Mindestnote von “ausreichend” ist die Ausbildung abgeschlossen.\r\n        Die Auszubildenden erhalten einen Ausbildungsbrief zur/zum Medizinischen\r\n        Fachangestellten.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>\r\n        Wie hoch ist die Ausbildungsvergütung für Medizinische Fachangestellte?\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Der\r\n        <b-link href=\"https://www.vmf-online.de/mfa/mfa-tarife\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n          >Verband Medizinischer Fachberufe e.V.
