Sobald es um das Thema Gehalt geht, fehlt vielen MFA das Gespür\n                für eine konkrete Zahl. Ein typisches Beispiel, das du bestimmt\n                auch kennst: du hast dich gerade auf einen Job beworben und der\n                neue Chef fragt dich nach deinen Gehaltsvorstellungen. Natürlich\n                willst du nicht zu dreist sein und das potenzielle Jobangebot\n                durch zu hohe Gehaltswünsche in Gefahr bringen. Deshalb gehen\n                viele medizinische Fachangestellte lieber auf Nummer sicher und\n                verkaufen sich unter Wert.\n            </p>\n            <h2>\n                Wie ermittelt man eigentlich seinen Marktwert?\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                In den vielen Gruppen und Foren kommen regelmäßig Fragen zur\n                Höhe des Gehalts für MFA auf. Wenn ich bei manchen Kommentaren\n                lese, dass eine MFA mit 15 Jahren Berufserfahrung in ein und\n                derselben Praxis mit 1.900 € brutto nach Hause geht, finde ich\n                das einfach nur traurig.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Damit dir das nicht passiert, bekommst du in diesem Artikel von\n                MFA mal anders Informationen über Gehalt, Tarifverträge und\n                Tätigkeitsgruppen. Mit diesem Wissen, kannst du deinen eigenen\n                Marktwert einordnen und für einen leistungsorientierten und\n                fairen Lohn einstehen.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Vorweg klären wir zuerst ein paar Begrifflichkeiten und wie die\n                vertragliche Lage aussieht.\n            </p>\n            <h2>\n                Gehaltstarifverträge\n            </h2>\n            <b-row>\n                <b-col>\n                    <p>\n                        Der Verband medizinischer Fachberufe e.V.

Sie vertritt uns medizinische\n                        Fachangestellte bei Tarifverhandlungen gegenüber der\n                        Arbeitsgemeinschaft zur Regelung der Arbeitsbedingungen\n                        der ArzthelferInnen/Medizinischen Fachangestellten\n                        (AAA). Die AAA ist die Tarifpartei der Arbeitgeber,\n                        sprich der niedergelassenen Ärzte.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Die niedergelassenen Ärzte sind nicht automatisch\n                        Mitglied in der AAA. Deshalb kann man nicht zwingend\n                        davon ausgehen, dass sich Praxen an die Gehälter im\n                        Tarifvertrag halten müssen. Arbeitgeber sind nur dann\n                        dazu verpflichtet Gehälter nach Tarifvertrag zu zahlen,\n                        wenn sowohl sie Mitglied im AAA als auch die MFA\n                        Mitglied im VMF sind.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Ehrlich gesagt, kenne ich nicht viele MFAs, die Mitglied\n                        im VMF sind. Daher wundert es auch nicht, dass so viele\n                        von uns untertariflich verdienen, wie die Kollegin aus\n                        dem Forum im obigen Beispiel.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Dennoch gibt es viele Ärzte, die sich freiwillig an den\n                        aktuellen Tarifvertrag halten oder zumindest das Gehalt\n                        für ihre medizinischen Fachangestellten daran anlehnen.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Neben dem offiziellen Tarifvertrag existieren zahlreiche\n                        Gehaltstarifverträge von privaten Unternehmen,\n                        Krankenhäusern, dem öffentlichen Dienst (z.B. wenn du\n                        bei der Kassenärztlichen Vereinigung arbeitest) und\n                        kirchlichen Trägern (wie der Caritas, der Diakonie oder\n                        der Johanniter).\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Es kommt im privaten Bereich oftmals zu einer\n                        außertariflichen Bezahlung. Das muss nicht unbedingt\n                        negativ für dich ausfallen. Viele MFA werden dadurch\n                        übertariflich bezahlt.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Wenn dein Chef kein Mitglied im AAA ist, du aber darauf\n                        bestehst, dass dein Gehalt nach Tarifvertrag bezahlt\n                        wird, kannst du alternativ mit deinem Arbeitgeber\n                        vereinbaren, dass er sich freiwillig daran hält. Hier\n                        ist es ratsam, eine entsprechende Klausel im\n                        Arbeitsvertrag aufnehmen zu lassen, die die Abmachung\n                        bindend macht.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Der Tarifvertrag hat natürlich auch einen ganz\n                        entscheidenden Vorteil: er wird regelmäßig neu\n                        verhandelt. Das Gehalt wird somit beinahe jährlich immer\n                        etwas angepasst und erhöht. Ist dein Chef verpflichtet\n                        nach Tarifvertrag zu zahlen oder hält sich freiwillig\n                        daran, musst du also keine Gehaltsverhandlungen mit dem\n                        Chef führen.\n                    </p>\n                </b-col>\n                <b-col>\n                    <p>\n                        Daneben bietet der Gehaltstarifvertrag für medizinische\n                        Fachangestellte dir vor allem eine gute Orientierung, um\n                        deinen Marktwert einzuschätzen, was Qualifikation und\n                        Erfahrung angehen.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Den aktuellen Gehaltstarifvertrag für medizinische\n                        Fachangestellte findest du\n                        <a\n                            href=\"https://www.vmf-online.de/mfa/mfa-tarife\"\n                            target=\"_blank\"\n                            rel=\"noopener\"\n                            >hier</a\n                        >.\n                    </p>\n                    <Gehaltsrechner class=\"my-5\" />\n                </b-col>\n            </b-row>\n\n            <h2>\n                Anrechnung von Berufsjahren\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                Ein wichtiger Indikator für die Höhe des Gehalts von MFA sind\n                Erfahrung und Expertise, die man sich im Laufe seines\n                Berufslebens aneignet. Je länger man im Beruf ist, desto mehr\n                kann man logischerweise an Gehalt verlangen.

Denn Geld alleine macht auch nicht\n                glücklich. Es muss das Gesamtpaket stimmen. Dazu zählen vor\n                allem das Klima im Team, die Arbeitszeiten, der Weg zur Arbeit,\n                interessante Aufgaben, die fordern und fördern (Stickwort\n                Weiterbildungen und Fortbildungen) oder die Möglichkeit Home\n                Office zu machen.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Wenn das angebotene Gehalt auf den ersten Blick nicht besonders\n                reizvoll ist, erkundige dich nach den Benefits. Das können\n                monetäre oder nicht monetäre Sonderleistungen sein. Das\n                (unzufriedenstellende) Gehalt wird dadurch kompensiert und der\n                Job bzw. den Arbeitgeber attraktiver.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Inwiefern sich ein Benefit für dich wirklich lohnt, entscheidet\n                oft die individuelle Lebenslage. Prüfe deshalb die angebotenen\n                Zusatzleistungen eines Arbeitgebers und gehe zur Not auch in die\n                Nachverhandlung und frage, ob man sich über bestimmte\n                Zusatzleistungen einigen kann.\n            </p>\n            <p>Einige Beispiele für Benefits</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Übernahme von Fortbildungskosten</li>\n                <li>Jobticket für öffentliche Verkehrsmittel</li>\n                <li>Zuzahlung zu Kita-Gebühren oder hauseigene Kita</li>\n                <li>Übertarifliche Anzahl an Urlaubstagen</li>\n                <li>Monatsgehalt/ Urlaubsgeld</li>\n                <li>\n                    Zulage zur privaten Rentenversicherung, Betriebsrente,\n                    Lebens-, Unfall-, Berufsunfähigkeitsversicherung etc.\n                </li>\n                <li>Beteiligung am Gewinn/ Prämien</li>\n                <li>Angebot von Home Office</li>\n                <li>Ein individuelles Arbeitszeitmodell</li>\n                <li>Dienstwagen</li>\n                <li>Essensgutscheine für die Mittagspause</li>\n                <li>\n                    Beteiligung an Gesundheitsleistungen, z.B.

Es muss aber ein gewisses Level haben mit\n                dem man seinen Lebensunterhalt ohne Schwierigkeiten finanzieren\n                kann.
